function [mf,FG,cs,ct] = maxflow(G,s,t)
%MAXFLOW Maximum flow in an undirected graph
%   MF = MAXFLOW(G,S,T) returns the maximum flow between two nodes S and T.
%   MF is equal to zero if no flow exists between nodes S and T.
%
%   All edge weights must be non-negative. If the graph G has no weights,
%	MAXFLOW treats all edges as having weight equal to 1.
%
%   [MF,GF] = MAXFLOW(G,S,T) also returns a digraph of flows GF formed only
%   from those edges of G that have non-zero flow values.
%
%   [MF,GF,CS,CT] = MAXFLOW(G,S,T) also returns two vectors of node ids, CS
%   and CT, representing a minimum cut associated with the maximum flow.
%   A minimum cut partitions the graph nodes into two sets CS and CT,
%   such that the sum of the weights of all edges connecting CS and CT
%   (weight of the cut) is minimized.
%   The entries of CS indicate the nodes of G associated with node S.
%   The entries of CT indicate the nodes of G associated with node T.
%   The weight of the minimum cut is equal to the maximum flow value MF
%   and NUMEL(CS) + NUMEL(CT) = NUMNODES(G).
%
%   Example:
%       % Create and plot a weighted graph whose edge weights represent
%       % flow capacities. Compute the maximum flow from node 1 to node 6.
%       s = [1 1 2 2 3 4 4 4 5];
%       t = [2 3 3 4 5 3 5 6 6];
%       weights = [0.77 0.44 0.67 0.75 0.89 0.90 2 0.76 1];
%       G = graph(s,t,weights);
%       plot(G,'EdgeLabel',G.Edges.Weight)
%       mf = maxflow(G,1,6)
