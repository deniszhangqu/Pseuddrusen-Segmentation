function c = condensation(g)
%CONDENSATION Graph condensation
%   C = CONDENSATION(G) returns the condensation of digraph G such that
%   each node of digraph C represents a strongly connected component of G.
%   There is an edge (I,J) in C if there is an edge from any node in
%   component I to any node in component J of G. C is acyclic and
%   topologically sorted.
